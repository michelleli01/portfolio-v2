					<p>
						I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft for two summers: after my sophomore
						year and after my junior year. Throughout my time on the AVS team, I was honored to have
						the opportunity to learn from and work with such a talented group of engineers. Due to
						the sensitive nature of the projects, I am unable to publicly share my work. If you're
						interested in hearing more about my work at Microsoft, please <a
							href="mailto:myl39@cornell.edu"

						<h3 class="font-semibold text-heading-3">Summer 2022</h3>
						I started at Microsoft during summer 2022 after my sophomore year and my project was, on
						a high level, to:
						<div class="flex items-center justify-center p-8 font-bold w-[60ch] mx-auto">
							Develop an automation script that validates a list of criteria for resource deployment
							to AVS servers
						</div>
					</div>

						<div>
							<h3 class="font-semibold text-heading-3">Summer 2023</h3>
							I returned again to Microsoft during summer 2023, after my junior year, and as a returning
							intern to the same team, the complexity and scope of the my project increased signficantly.
							On a high level, my project was to:
							<div class="flex items-center justify-center p-8 font-bold w-[60ch] mx-auto">
								Integrate an in-house service into the live product, replacing the previously used
								third party service.
							</div>
						</div>

								<i>Here are some of takeways I gained from this experience:</i>
								<ul
									class="flex flex-col gap-4 list-decimal list-outside pt-4 pl-5 w-[75ch] mx-auto"
								>
									<li>
										<p class="font-semibold pb-2">
											Be proactive and take ownership of your own learning. Ask for help.
										</p>
										It's quite intimidating at first to reach out to senior-level engineers, but that
										is the best way to properly learn. The right team will support you and help you grow.
										It's faster and easier to ask others first instead of trying to figure everything
										out on your own.<br /> If you're stuck on something,
										<i>go to someone and ask for help!</i>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="font-semibold pb-2">It's ok to make mistakes!</p>
										You're not going to get everything exactly right the first time and that is totally
										ok.
										<i>Stay open to feedback and continue to grow from them.</i>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="font-semibold pb-2">
											Don't try and learn everything all at once, you're not going to be able to
											understand everything.
										</p>
										With such an extensive codebase containing hundreds of thousands of lines of code
										and a system composed of various microservices that all deviate from standard in
										some unique way, it is impossible to fully understand every detail.
										<i
											>Focus on what you need to know and gain a high level understanding.
											Everything else will come to you over time. There's no rush!</i
										>
									</li>
								</ul>

							Again, it was a pleasure to have this opportunity and I'm incredibly grateful for
							everyone on the AVS team! I enjoyed my time so much at Microsoft, I decided to return
							full time as a software engineer in New York City starting Feburary 2024.
