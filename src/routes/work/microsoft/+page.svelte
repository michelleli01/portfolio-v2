					<p>
						I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft for two summers: after my sophomore
						year and after my junior year. Throughout my time on the team, I was honored to have the
						opportunity to learn from and work with a talented group of engineers. Due to the
						sensitive nature of the projects, I am unable to publicly share my work on the
						Infrastructure Services team. If you're interested in hearing more about my work at
						Microsoft, please <a

						I started at Microsoft during summer 2022 after my sophomore year and my primary responsbilities
						were to:
						<ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
							<li>Onboard onto the Infrastructure Services team</li>
							<li>
								Develop an automation script that validates a list of criteria for resource
								deployment to Azure VmWare Solution (AVS) servers
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

							<h3 class="font-semibold text-heading-3">Summer 2023</h3>
							I returned again to Microsoft during summer 2023, after my junior year, and as a returning
							intern to the same team, the complexity and scope of the my project increased.

							<div>
								Here are some of takeways I gained from this this entire experience:
								<ul class="list-decimal list-outside pl-5">
									<li>
										<p class="font-semibold">
											Be proactive and take ownership of your own learning.
										</p>
										It's quite intimidating at first to reach out to senior-level engineers, but that
										is the best way to properly learn the system.<br /><i
											>Go to the person who wrote it and ask lots of questions!</i
										>
									</li>
									<li>
										It's ok to make mistakes! You're not going to get everything exactly right the
										first time and that is totally ok. <i
											>Stay open to feedback and continue to grow from them.</i
										>
									</li>
									<li>
										Don't worry too much about the details. With such an extensive codebase
										containing hundreds of thousands of lines of code, it is impossible to fully
										understand every line and every microservice. Focus on what you need to know and
										gain a high level understanding. Everything else will come to you as you work.
