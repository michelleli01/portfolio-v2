I think I've always gravitated towards backend development because of how tedious and unnecessarily complex frontend development was with **React.js** and **Bootstrap** when I first started out, especially as a little first year student. Because of this initial hurdle, I opted to label myself as a _"backend developer"_ very early on and never really touched frontend development again.

However, recently due to some inspiration from my incredibly smart, front-end savy friends and because I have more free time, having just recently graduated, I decided to take another look at frontend development, especially since my understanding and experience with the web and software engineering has improved greatly since I first started almost 4 years ago.

So, when my friend said she wanted to cancel her Squarespace subscription and needed to migrate her portfolio elsewhere, I offered to code up her portfolio for her using her designs on Figma.

### Picking the Framework(s)

For a simple porfolio website, I knew React would be completely overkill and slow, so I decided to learn a new framework. I considered just going vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but _where's the fun in that_? I wanted to learn something new.

Svelte has risen significantly in popularity in recent years and I knew nothing about it expect that it's "lightweight" and "fun." So, I decided to give it a go!

TailwindCSS is also another CSS framework that I had been hearing a ton of buzz about, so I just threw that into the mix too.

### The Journey
