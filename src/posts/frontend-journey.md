I think I've always gravitated towards backend development because of how tedious and unnecessarily complex frontend development was with [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) when I first started out 4 years ago. Because of this initial hurdle, I opted to label myself as a _"backend developer"_ very early on and never really touched frontend development again.

However, recently due to some inspiration from my incredibly smart, front-end savvy friends and because I have more free time (having just recently graduated), I decided to take another look at frontend development, especially since my understanding and experience with the web and software engineering has improved greatly since I first started almost 4 years ago.

So, when my friend said she wanted to cancel her Squarespace subscription and needed to migrate her portfolio elsewhere, I offered to code up her portfolio for her using her designs on Figma.

### Picking the Framework(s)

For a simple porfolio website, I knew React would be completely overkill and slow. I considered just going vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but _where's the fun in that_? **I wanted to learn something new.**

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) has risen significantly in popularity in recent years and I knew nothing about it except that it's "lightweight" and "fun." So, I decided to give it a go!

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindui.com/) is also another CSS framework that I had heard a ton of buzz about, so I just threw that into the mix too.

With these two crucial frameworks, I began my journey to _frontend enlightenment_.

### The Journey

Since my friend had all the necessary Figma files ready, I was able to focus on just playing around with the tech stack. **I had complete ownership of the code**.

As I started working and learning about the new technologies I was utilizing, I found myself being actively excited to work on the project. I even began to procrastinate on studying for my final to work on it. Additionally, _this project even began eating away at my free time_.

The real-time satisfaction of seeing the website come to life with every little change was incredibly rewarding.

While I definitely didn't follow "best practices", I was able to (almost) completely refresh my knowledge on CSS and learn how to use a cool new framework along the way! I am by no means an expert on SvelteKit/TailwindCSS and this simple project definitely did not require me to fully explore the complexities and intriacies of frontend development. But, **I had fun**.

You can check out the finished project [here](https://larrisachen.com)! I'm pretty happy how it turned out (it's quite a simple static website).

### Conclusion

Being able to constantly solve problems (no matter how trivial) while coming up with unique, creative solutions is what drew me into software engineering all those years ago.

I'm not to proclaim myself as a frontend developer and I still definitely have my qualms, But, **this small side project relit my excitment and passion for software engineer** and I have a greater appreciation for the field.

The web development landscape has already changed so much since when I first started almost 4 years ago. I definitely want to dabble in and play around with all this cool new technology.

My next learning challenge:
**Develop a full stack web application with the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/).**

and...

figure out CSS animations with TailwindCSS to make this portfolio site more interesting.
